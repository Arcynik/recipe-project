# recipe-project

Technical experiment I made for Aqsone's recruitement process.
I would recommend to run
```
npm install
```
then
```
npm run serve
```
for a local working version of the app

/!\ The public API called by the app only authorizes 5 requests (per minute per user) which means that if you perform more than 5 researches in a minute, you won't get any results.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
